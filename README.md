Face recognition is an interesting field for application of artificial intelligence. Three objectives can be considered in such a research study. These have to do with face localization, alignment and identiﬁcation. Although becoming a mature ﬁeld, many challenges still remain to be handled for face recognition. Pose and illumination variations, face similarities within a family as well as possible diﬃculties to ﬁnd enough training samples (which also need to have high enough resolution) for each subject are some of these challenges. From obtaining the raw data to providing them to a face recognition algorithm some processes are obligatory such as locating the face in a camera image and aligning it to prevent suﬀering from noise due to variances of pose and illumination.
In this research, different approaches for face recognition will be studied. An efficient approach is selected to design and implement in MATLAB software package. The obtained results in the research will be developed in the MATLAB and presented after analysis of the outcomes.
